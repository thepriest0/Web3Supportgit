## ðŸ”§ Deployment Requirements

### Environment Variables Needed:
- `VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` - For WalletConnect integration
- `VITE_ALCHEMY_API_KEY` - For RPC connections (optional, has fallbacks)

### Infrastructure Requirements:
- Node.js 18+ runtime environment
- Static file serving capability  
- HTTPS support (required for Web3 wallet connections)
- Port 5000 or custom PORT environment variable

### Build Commands:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

## ðŸš€ Production Deployment Steps

1. **Clone/Deploy Code**: Deploy the application to your hosting platform
2. **Set Environment Variables**: Configure WalletConnect Project ID
3. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` 
4. **Build Application**: Run `npm run build`
5. **Start Server**: Run `npm start`
6. **Verify HTTPS**: Ensure SSL certificate is properly configured
7. **Test Wallet Connections**: Verify Web3 functionality works correctly

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Analytics

The application includes:
- Console logging for development debugging
- Error boundaries for graceful failure handling  
- Transaction status tracking
- Network connectivity monitoring
- Wallet connection state management

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations

- No sensitive data stored in localStorage
- Wallet private keys never transmitted to server
- Read-only smart contract interactions (no destructive operations)
- Proper CORS configuration
- Secure environment variable handling

## âœ… Production Status: READY

This Web3 support dApp is production-ready and can be deployed immediately. All core functionality is implemented, tested, and optimized for real-world usage.
